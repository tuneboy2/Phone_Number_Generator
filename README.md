#  A PHONE NUMBER GENERATOR
## **Description**
This program generates a new random telephone number for it's user.
 The program generates a number starting with a `0` digit, a Second number that is either a digit `8` or a `9`, and a Third number that is either a `0` or `1`.
 
 The language of choice is `C`, and its fair to say that this program was born whilst I was learning the `C` programming language
